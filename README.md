## Pitches and triggers
- C3 is set at 2V. This is to allow transposing octaves up as well as down for modules that only take positive voltage as pitch input
- Setting a step's pitch that has no triggers enables trigger at tick 1 of the step
- Disabling a step's pitch that has one or more triggers disables all triggers
- Changing a step's pitch that has one or more triggers changes the pitch and leaves the triggers as is
- Pressing a track's trigger button whilst holding it's pitch button mutes/unmutes that track
